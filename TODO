- Optimize with UIObject.changed
- See if we can make resizing update during resizing.
    - See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78384007/raylib-when-resizing-the-window-the-background-is-black
- Move Sprite into UI ?
- Make it so overlapping clickables are not both clicked?
- Fix loops (either allow them and display them or do not allow them)
- Make it so you cannot place vertices out of bounds.
### 2D Cartesian Projection using Eigenvectors
Another view of the graph, which uses the graph's eigenvectors as cartesian coordinates. This can provide useful representations of graphs, with aspects like minimal edge overlapping. The coordinates are calculated by finding the two smallest non-zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, and then using their corresponding eigenvectors as 2d cartesian coordinates.
### Information on Vertices and Edges
The number of vertices and edges is displayed in the top left corner.
### Information on Degree of Vertices
The maximum and minimum degree of the graph is displayed in the top left corner and when an individual vertex is selected, it's degree is displayed in the bottom center.
### Information on Components
The number of components is displayed in the top left corner.
### Graphics
Isperia uses the Raylib library for a simpler access to graphics. It also allows for easy cross-platform graphics, like compiling to both machine code and WebAssembly.

DONE:
- fix resizing window bugs
- Implement sprites
    - UIObjects have a reference to a sprite that they draw. (depending on width, height, etc.)
    - Rectangle
    - Oval
    - Bitmap
